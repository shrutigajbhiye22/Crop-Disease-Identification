# Crop-Disease-Identification
Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. For Training we are using Plant village dataset.

## ‚≠êRun Project in your Machine
* You must have python install in your machine.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewJWAiduGuld_9oGSrTuLumg9y62qS6A?usp=share_link)
* Add the downloaded file in `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.

## Contribution
* Clear Guidelines: Provide clear instructions on how to contribute, including forking, coding standards, and testing.
* Issue Tracker: Maintain an issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions.
* Communication Channels: Set up forums for questions and discussions.
* Testing and CI: Ensure automated tests and continuous integration.
* Documentation: Keep thorough project documentation.
* License: Specify the project's open-source license.
* Review Process: Define a review process for pull requests.
* Inclusivity: Welcome contributors from diverse backgrounds.

* Responsiveness: Be prompt and respectful in responding to issues and pull requests.
By following these steps, you can create an open-source environment that encourages and supports contributions from developers.


## Testing Images
* Test Image Folder: Keep test images in a folder (e.g., "test_images").
* Documentation: Provide clear instructions on how to use test images for model evaluation.
* Diverse Cases: Include various disease examples, severity levels, and environmental conditions.
* Ground Truth: If possible, provide actual disease labels for the test images.
* Sample Outputs: Include expected output examples for reference.
* Automate Testing: Offer scripts or tools for automated model testing.
* Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on model performance.
* Keep Updated: Continuously update test images and documentation as project evolves.
